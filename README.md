# To do #

- 2017-02-12 Printing order of shadow postings: Print all APLs first,
  then all SPLs
- 2017-02-12 Error checking: For each real posting, check that sum of
  shadow postings equals real posting value
- 2017-02-09 First run Ledger to make sure that the journal file does
  not have errors
- 2017-02-07 Modify code to just delete the Xact and start over (instead
  of clearing the Xact)
- 2017-02-05 Add stub to indicate that this transaction is not supposed
  to have a shadow tag
- 2017-01-26 `Shadow: APL` allocates 100% to APL
- 2017-01-23 Add way to check which transactions do not have Shadow
  tags
